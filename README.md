- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zacck

I'm obsessed with embedded systems and how they work. In reality I would love to implement a multiboard, multiprotocol distributed embedded system something like what we have in Automobile systems. 

I often LiveCode my learning sessions on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Gaiaochos). Usually on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 9am SAST. Let's dive deep into Embedded systems.
